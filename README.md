# tsp-ga-visualizer

## Description

This is an interactive web application that visualizes how a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** can be used to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The visualizer allows you to see how different parameters (such as population size, mutation rate, elitism rate, and generations) affect the algorithm's ability to find the shortest possible route through a set of cities.

### Features
- Visualize the process of solving the TSP using a Genetic Algorithm.
- Add and remove points with click
- Scale the canvas to get a better view of added coordinates
- Adjust parameters like **population size**, **mutation rate**, and **generations** to observe their impact on convergence speed and solution quality.
- Implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the index.html file with a browser of your choice
3. Experiment with different parameters
